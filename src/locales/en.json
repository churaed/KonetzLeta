To solve the artistic challenge—telling Ancient Greek myths associated with the god Hephaestus through imagery familiar to brigade members—we chose the following stylistic approach: the entire narrative unfolds on the surface of a 'tselinka' (a special student brigade jacket), while all characters, locations, and special effects are represented by elements that no 'battle-hardened' tselinka is complete without: badges, patches, and drawings directly on the jacket.",
